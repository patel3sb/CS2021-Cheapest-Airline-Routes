Introduction
The project is called Affordable Flight Ticket Planning and was completed by one person. The app helps the user find the cheapest set of flights to take to reach from start to destination. The idea was inspired by countless websites online that come up with the cheapest air travel options while adding a lot of time and layovers in the process. While not always the best option, booking tickets this way is very cheap if one is fine with trading time and energy.
My vision for this project was to create a website that would ask the user to enter the start and destination cities and display the cheapest flight routes to get from start to end. Again, this is not always the best option but it was fun to create it and see how weird the routes get to make the costs cheaper.
Since I decided to create a Python web-app, the project includes a lot of 3rd party libraries. The main framework is Flask which is a Python library to create web applications with the latest standards and the Python programming language. 
For the frontend, I used UI Kit to create the necessary form styling and indentations on the website and Google Maps API to draw the air routes on the map. To help with preprocessing, the Python wrapper for the Google maps API helped get coordinates for cities.
